![Header](ugo-banner.png)



I am a software developer / data scientist who is passionate about creating technology to improve lives and economies. 

I am from Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ 

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge, I have built and designed websites for companies, government organisations and individuals. I have done lots of work in Data Science finding solutions to business problems which you can find some here in my repositories. I am currently working with Flutter to create crossplatform apps that solves real world problems and gives people joy. 

When I am not building or learning new stuff I love watching musical vidoes or doing some outdoor fun stuff
